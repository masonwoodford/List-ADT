Lex.c - This file contains the loops that sort an input file of text line by line 
alphabetically and output them to an output text file.

List.c - This file contains the implementation of a doubly linked list with numerous
operations, as well as a cursor that highlights an element of the list to be operated
on. Its underlying operations are private, meaning that a client can only interact
with the list through the provided functions.

List.h - This is a header file that contains the function prototypes for List.c.

makefile - This is a text file that defines tasks to be executed in the Unix
environment. This includes compiling the program from source code, that can then
be run.
